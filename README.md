# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Profile

My name is Michael Vinyard. 

I'm currently working on my PhD at Harvard University where I am using single-cell genomics as well as CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-editing tools like (like base editing) to study cancer progression. This work is funded by an F31 through the NIH. The focus of this work is applying innovations in deep learning to analogous problems in the analysis of single-cell data. 

I am passionate about and interested in: 

- 🧿 (single-cell) epigenomics and chromatin biology
- 🧬 Functional annotation of variation in the human genome
- 🧮 Deep learning
- ✂️ Functional CRISPR studies
- 🧠 Psychiatric disorders
- 🧫 Cancer biology
- 🐍 Implementing open-source tools for genomics in python.
- 🎨 Computer graphics art
